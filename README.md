Having been using bitweaver for many years I have now retired from buisness and am 
carrying on things for enjoyment, not that maintaining PHP is a joy at times. 
I have several sites that have been live on bitweaver under PHP7.3 from their creating
and now I have moved them to a more modern webstack under PHP8.4 with Firebird5.
This form of the code is a little of a tangent from the main code base as I have also
hacking into Smarty5 and andded namespace to the mix. It's published here in the hope
someone might find parts of it useful.
